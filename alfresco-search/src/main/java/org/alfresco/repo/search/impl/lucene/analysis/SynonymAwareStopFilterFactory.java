/**
 * A {@link StopFilter} which doesn't remove stop tokens previously marked as part of a synonym.
 * When using a stop filter in a query analyzer which already includes a synonym filter, there are two options:
 * the filter could be defined before or after the synonym filter.
 *
 * However, the first way (before) doesnâ€™t make so much sense, because terms that are stopwords and that are, at the same
 * time, part of a synonym will be removed before the synonym detection. As consequence of that no synonym detection will happen.
 *
 * If we have
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a stopwords list consisting of one term (of)</li>
 *     <li>and a single synonym definition like "out of warranty,oow"</li>
 *     <li>a query which should match the synonym: q=out of warranty</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * a stop filter defined before the synonym filter would remove the "of" term from the query, therefore causing the missing
 * synonym detection. If we postpone the stop filter after the synonym filter, the synonym will be detected, but the
 * stop filter later would still remove the "of" token causing the open issue well described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-4065
 *
 * Being related with FilteringTokenFilter (the StopFilter superclass) LUCENE-4065 has a wider scope which doesn't affect only
 * stopwords removal. However, in order to mitigate the issue above, this custom stop filter takes in account the typeAttribute of the
 * incoming tokens; it removes them only if they are stopwords and if they haven't been marked as part of a synonym ({@link SynonymGraphFilter#TYPE_SYNONYM})
