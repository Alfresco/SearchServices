########### ENGLISH SYNONYMS
# This file lists several scenarios where synonyms could be applied for improving the
# search effectiveness.
# Important: the current Alfresco configuration lowecases the input stream before the Synonyms management plays its role;
# that's the reason why in this file all terms, concepts, are in lowercase.
# Making such assumption introduces some optimization but at the same time it requires the synonyms maintainer to be
# careful about *not* using capitalized letters.
# The alternative, much expensive in terms of computation but definitely more "end-user-friendly", is to declare the ignoreCase
# attribute as "false" (you can also remove the attribute from the field definition, as "false" is its default value)

### EX. 3: MULTI-TERM CONCEPTS WITHOUT SYNONYMS
# In this case, we have compound concepts we would like to manage as a whole, but we don't have any synonyms.
# As you can see, we can just double their definition therefore forcing the creation of a "dummy" synonym which is the concept itself
