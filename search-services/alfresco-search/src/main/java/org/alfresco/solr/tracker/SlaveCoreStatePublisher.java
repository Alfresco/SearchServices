/**
 * Despite belonging to the Tracker ecosystem, this component is actually a publisher, which periodically informs
 * Alfresco about the state of the hosting slave core.
 * As the name suggests, this worker is scheduled only when the owning core acts as a slave.
 * It allows Solr's master/slave setup to be used with dynamic shard registration.
 *
 * In this scenario the slave is polling a "tracking" Solr node. The tracker below calls
 * the repo to register the state of the node without pulling any real transactions from the repo.
 *
 * This allows the repo to register the replica so that it will be included in queries. But the slave Solr node
 * will pull its data from a "tracking" Solr node using Solr's master/slave replication, rather then tracking the repository.
