/**
*  The HybridBitSet is a random access (doesn't support iteration) BitSet implementation that uses a FixedBitSet for the first N bits
*  and a HashSet for higher bits. This is designed to provide a balance between the high performance of FixedBitSet and
*  the efficient sparse behavior of a HashSet.
