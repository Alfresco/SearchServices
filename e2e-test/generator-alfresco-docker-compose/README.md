```

* `.env` includes default values for Docker Compose environment variables
* `docker-compose-ce.yml` is the base Docker Compose Template for Alfresco Community deployment (for ACS 6.2 and ACS 6.1)
* `docker-compose-ee.yml` is the base Docker Compose Template for Alfresco Enterprise deployment (for ACS 6.2 and ACS 6.1)
* `alfresco` includes a Dockerfile template to start Alfresco Repository
  * `model` includes a default content model (Sharding Explicit Routing or empty). This `empty` file is required for Dockerfile to work, so it should not be deleted.
* `share` includes a Dockerfile template to start Share Web Application
  * `model` includes a default forms model (Sharding Explicit Routing or empty)
* `search` includes a Dockerfile template to start Search Services and Insight Engine
* `config` includes configuration for HTTP Web Proxy (NGINX)
* `zeppelin` includes a Dockerfile template to start Zeppelin with SSL
* `keystores` includes every truststore and keystore required for SSL configuration


## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and link `generator-alfresco-docker-composel` using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm link
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-custom-docker-compose
$ yo alfresco-docker-compose
```

## ACS Version

Currently supported ACS Versions are `6.2` and `6.1`

This is the first choice to be selected when the generator is executed.

```
? Which ACS version do you want to use?
  6.1
❯ 6.2
```
## AGS Version

Currently supported AGS Version is `latest` (based in ACS 6.1).

If you chose ACS 6.1, a prompt will allow you to use AGS.

```
? Would you like to use AGS? Yes
```

## Community

When using Community, some different options can be combined:

* Plain HTTP (http) or TLS/SSL Mutual Authentication (https) for communication between Alfresco and SOLR
* Plain HTTP (http) or HTTPs (https) for Http Web Proxy for HTTP access to services
* Protect the access to SOLR REST API in the Http WebProxy to forbid direct access to Alfresco Web Proxy port
* Use SOLR Replication in Master/Slave mode (only when using http)

```
? Would you like to use Alfresco enterprise or community? community
? Would you like to use HTTP or mTLS for Alfresco-SOLR communication? http
? Would you like to use HTTP or HTTPs for Web Proxy? http
? Would you like to protect the access to SOLR REST API? Yes
? Would you like to use a SOLR Replication (2 nodes in master-slave)? No
```

**Note** that when choosing *mTLS* or *HTTPs*, default certificates, truststores and keystores are provided for testing purposes. If you are planning to use this Docker Compose template for real environments, replace these cryptographic stores with another generated by yourself to increase the security of your system.

## Enterprise

When using Enterprise, some options can be added to Community configuration:

* Use dynamic Sharding with 2 SOLR nodes pre-configured (every sharding method is supported)
* Insight Engine, as Search Services is selected by default
* Deploy Zeppelin app to use JDBC Connector to SOLR

```
? Would you like to use dynamic Sharding (2 SOLR nodes)? Yes
? Which Sharding Method do you want to use?
❯ DB_ID
  DB_ID_RANGE
  ACL_ID
  MOD_ACL_ID
  DATE
  PROPERTY
  LAST_REGISTERED_INDEXING_SHARD
  EXPLICIT_ID_FALLBACK_LRIS
  EXPLICIT_ID  
? Would you like to use Insight Engine instead of Search Services? Yes
? Would you like to deploy Zeppelin? Yes
```

## Sharding methods default parameters

**DB_ID_RANGE**
Shard range is 0-800 for the instance 0 and 801-40000 for the instance 1.

**DATE**
Shard property is `cm:created` and grouping is set to 2.

**PROPERTY**
Shard property is `shard:shardId`, belonging to a custom model deployed in the template.

**EXPLICIT_ID** and **EXPLICIT_ID_FALLBACK_LRIS**
Custom content model is deployed to provide a property, named `shard:shardId`, holding the Shard Number (0, 1) where the content is indexed.

This default configuration can be changed in the generated `docker-compose.yml` template.


## Deploying custom content models and forms

Custom content models and Share Form configurations can be added to deployment folders.

**Content models**

Custom content models can be copied to Repository deployment folder by using bootstrap approach. 

Following XML files must be created in `alfresco/model/` folder in the Docker Compose template generated:

* `content-model.xml` including an XML Alfresco Content Model file. Sample model is available in [images/alfresco/model/sharding-content-model.xml](generators/app/templates/images/alfresco/model/sharding-content-model.xml)
* `content-model-context.xml` including an XML Spring Bean file with the `dictionaryBootstrap` bean. Sample Spring Bean declaration is available in [images/alfresco/model/sharding-content-model-context.xml](generators/app/templates/images/alfresco/model/sharding-content-model-context.xml)

If *Sharding* is selected, these files will be available in deployment folder.

**Share forms**

Custom content forms can be added to Share configuration by modifying `share/model/share-config-custom-dev.xml` file in the Docker Compose template generated.

Sample configuration is available in [images/share/model/sharding-share-config-custom.xml](generators/app/templates/images/share/model/sharding-share-config-custom.xml)

If *Sharding* is selected, a default `share-config-custom-dev.xml` file with required forms configuration for Sharding custom model will be available in deployment folder. Add your configuration to this file.

## Passing parameters from command line

Default values for options can be specified in the command line, using a `--name=value` pattern. When an options is specified in the command line, the question is not prompted to the user, so you can generate a Docker Compose template with no user interaction.

```
$ yo alfresco-docker-compose --acsVersion=6.2 --alfrescoVersion=community --httpMode=http --clustering=true
```

**Parameter names reference**

`--acsVersion`: default 6.2, but could be set to 6.1
`--ags:`: only available when acsVersion=6.1
`--alfrescoVersion`: community or enterprise
`--httpMode`: http or https
`--httpWebMode`: http or https
`--protectSolr`: true or false
`--clustering`: true or false
`--insightEngine`: true or false
`--zeppelin`: true or false
`--sharding`: true or false
`--shardingMethod`: DB_ID, DB_ID_RANGE, ACL_ID, MOD_ACL_ID, DATE, PROPERTY, LAST_REGISTERED_INDEXING_SHARD, EXPLICIT_ID_FALLBACK_LRIS, EXPLICIT_ID

## Using Docker Compose

Once the files have been generated, just start Docker Compose.

```
$ docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

You can shutdown it at any moment using following command.

```
$ docker-compose down
```
