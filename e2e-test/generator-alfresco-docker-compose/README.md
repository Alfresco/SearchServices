# generator-alfresco-docker-compose
> Alfresco Docker Compose Generator

This project generates a collection of Docker Compose Templates to test Repository and Search Services/Insight Engine with different configurations:

* Plain HTTP communications
* TLS/SSL Mutual Authentication communications
* Sharding (dynamic) with DB_ID or Explicit Routing
* Replication (master/slave)

## Project structure

Following templates are provided.

```
$ tree generators/app/templates/latest
├── .env

```

* `.env` includes default values for Docker Compose environment variables
* `docker-compose-ce.yml` is the base Docker Compose Template for Alfresco Community deployment
* `docker-compose-ee.yml` is the base Docker Compose Template for Alfresco Enterprise deployment
* `alfresco` includes a Dockerfile template to start Alfresco Repository
  * `model` includes a default content model for Sharding Explicit Routing
* `search` includes a Dockerfile template to start Search Services and Insight Engine
* `zeppelin` includes a Dockerfile template to start Zeppelin with SSL
* `keystores` includes every truststore and keystore required for SSL configuration


## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and link `generator-alfresco-docker-composel` using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm link
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-custom-docker-compose
$ yo alfresco-docker-compose
```

## Community

When using Community, some different options can be combined:

* Plain HTTP (http) or TLS/SSL Mutual Authentication (https)
* Use SOLR Replication in Master/Slave mode (only when using http)

```
? Which Alfresco version do you want to use? latest
? Would you like to use Alfresco enterprise or community? community
? Would you like to use http or https? http
? Would you like to use a SOLR Replication (2 nodes in master-slave)? Yes
```

## Enterprise

When using Enterprise, some options can be added to Community configuration:

* Use dynamic Sharding with 2 SOLR nodes pre-configured (only when not using SOLR Replication)
* Use Explicit Routing for Shards instead of DB_ID (only when using Sharding)
* Insight Engine, as Search Services is selected by default
* Deploy Zeppelin app to use JDBC Connector to SOLR

```
? Would you like to use dynamic Sharding (2 SOLR nodes)? Yes
? Would you like to use SOLR Explicit Routing instead of DB_ID for the Shards? Yes
? Would you like to use Insight Engine instead of Search Services? Yes
? Would you like to deploy Zeppelin? Yes
```

## Using Explicit Routing feature

Custom content model is deployed to provide a property, named `shard:shardId`, holding the Shard Number (0, 1) where the content is indexed.

## Configuration catalog

| Version    | Comms | Replication | Sharding | Explicit | Insight | Zeppelin |
| -          | -     | -           | -        | -        | -       | -        |
| community  | http  | -           | -        | -        | x       | x        |

| enterprise | http  | false       | true     | false    | (*)     | (*)      |
| enterprise | http  | false       | true     | true     | (*)     | (*)      |
| enterprise | https | x           | -        | -        | (*)     | (*)      |
| enterprise | https | x           | true     | false    | (*)     | (*)      |
| enterprise | https | x           | true     | true     | (*)     | (*)      |

Both `community` and `enterprise` ACS deployments can be used with the same options, but `enterprise` may also use Insight Engine (replacing Search Services) and Insight Zeppelin services.

## Passing parameters from command line

Default values for options can be specified in the command line, using a `--name=value` pattern. When an options is specified in the command line, the question is not prompted to the user, so you can generate a Docker Compose template with no user interaction.

```
$ yo alfresco-docker-compose --acsVersion=latest --alfrescoVersion=community --httpMode=http --clustering=true
```

**Parameter names reference**

`--acsVersion`: default latest, but could be set to e.g. 6.1.0.5
`--alfrescoVersion`: community or enterprise
`--httpMode`: http or https
`--clustering`: true or false
`--insightEngine`: true or false
`--zeppelin`: true or false
`--sharding`: true or false
`--explicitRouting`: true or false


## Using Docker Compose

Once the files have been generated, just start Docker Compose.

```
$ docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

You can shutdown it at any moment using following command.

```
$ docker-compose down
```
